# FoodDelight - Responsive Layout Assignment(Internship Project)

This project(TASK 3) was completed as part of my internship with Innomatics Research Labs.
The layout adapts to various screen sizes, including mobile, tablet, and desktop, using **CSS Grid** and **media queries**.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following key files:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the website.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file that handles the styling and responsiveness of the layout.

## Features

### 1. Responsive Design
- The layout is fully responsive, adjusting to different screen sizes such as:
  - **Mobile devices** (up to 768px)
  - **Tablets** (769px to 1024px)
  - **Desktop devices** (1450px and above)
  
- Media queries are used to adjust elements such as:
  - Navigation layout
  - Button sizing
  - Image scaling
  - Grid layout for dishes and testimonials

### 2. Layout Sections
The website contains the following key sections:
- **Header:** Includes the logo, navigation menu, and a call-to-action "Order Now" button.
- **Hero Section:** Features a full-width background image with text and an "Explore Menu" button.
- **Featured Dishes:** Displays popular dishes in a grid format, showcasing images, dish names, and prices.
- **Signup Section:** Allows users to sign up for a newsletter by entering their email.
- **Testimonials:** Displays customer reviews in a grid format.
- **Footer:** Contains copyright information and social media links.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: Semantic elements are used for structure.
- **CSS3**: 
  - **CSS Grid** for layout design.
  - **Flexbox** for alignment in certain sections.
  - **Media queries** to handle responsiveness.
  - **CSS transitions** for hover effects.
  
## How to View the Project
1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in any web browser.
3. Resize the browser window to see how the layout adapts to different screen sizes.

## Future Improvements
- Implement a mobile-friendly navigation menu (e.g., a hamburger menu).
- Add more animations or interactive elements to enhance user experience.
